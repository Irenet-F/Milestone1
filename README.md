So far, I feel very behind on this project since most of my time had to be spent catching up and understanding earlier concepts in the course. BUT I feel very hopeful. The more that I play around with the dataset as I'm learning how to tidy data, the more that the lessons are coming together for me.

This is just one of the many datasets that I must prepare for my final project. Right now, I see that tidying the data is going to be the most time-consuming part. And the graphs will be pretty simple. With that said, that's why I wanted to make sure that I show what I've learned and apply it to the earlier part of my work since my audience truly wants something simple without all the bells and whistles. I fear that my project will not look as elaborate as the rest of my classmates, although I will try to make it as appealing as possible. I have a long way to go before I'm done, so I'm embracing my adaptability as I'm sure this will be something that will come up in real-life situations in my career, where I have a short amount of time to make something amazing and presentable.
